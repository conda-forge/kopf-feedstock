  summary: 'A Python framework to write Kubernetes operators in just a few lines of code '
  description: |
    Kopf —Kubernetes Operator Pythonic Framework— is a framework and a library to make Kubernetes
    operators development easier, just in a few lines of Python code.

    The main goal is to bring the Domain-Driven Design to the infrastructure level, with Kubernetes
    being an orchestrator/database of the domain objects (custom resources), and the operators containing
    the domain logic (with no or minimal infrastructure logic).

    The project was originally started as zalando-incubator/kopf in March 2019, and then forked as
    nolar/kopf in August 2020: but it is the same codebase, the same packages, the same developer(s).
